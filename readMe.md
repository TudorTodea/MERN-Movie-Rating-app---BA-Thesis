## Reflection
 

This project's was my first big project using react, the goal was to familiarize myself with the MERN stack functionality and implement everything that I have learned so far.  

 I wanted to build an application that allowed users to create an account and have to possibility to search for different movies, either by a search bar component or an either page were the latest movies that hit the cinema, are being shown, these movies could be filtered by genre, as well as give movie ratings, add to watchlist or favorite movie list , or read and give reviews. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router` . After that I created the backend server directory and initialized an Express server on it, before connecting to the MongoDB Atlas database that I created. The movies data is provided from the TMDB API.   

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) ![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/bootstrap-%23563D7C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white) ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![React Router](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=for-the-badge&logo=react-router&logoColor=white) ![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white) ![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white). I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
